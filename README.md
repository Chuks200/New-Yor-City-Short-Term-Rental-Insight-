##### Top 5 average rental prices in New York City Neighborhood

### RECOMMENDATION AND CONCLUSION
In recommendation to Pillow Palooza, this points should be put into consideration
- Williamsburg should be considered as a better neighbourhood to start-up an Airbnb short-term rental, this is because it has the highest amount of booking per year in New York City. It should also be rented on an average price of Â£142 to be affordable for customers.
- Entire home/apartment and private rooms should be the properties to be invested in, this is because people in the New York neighbourhood prefer to rent such properties than the share room apartment.

In conclusion, from the SQL analysis and tableau presentation, it shows how important and profitable the New York Airbnb investment is, and Williamsburg is a suitable neighbourhood for pillow palooza to invest in, this is with the aid of properties such as entire home/apartment and private rooms.
